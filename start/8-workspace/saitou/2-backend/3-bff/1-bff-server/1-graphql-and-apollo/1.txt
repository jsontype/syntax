1. REST API (Representational State Transfer)
  RESTful is an architectural style 
    that defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP,
    which makes it easy to communicate between different systems.
  # GET: http://...com/api/v1/users // read all
  # GET: http://...com/api/v1/users/:id // read one
  # POST: /api/v1/users/create // create
  # PUT: /api/v1/users/update/:id // update
  # DELETE: /api/v1/users/delete/:id // delete

1. GraphQL
  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime
    for executing queries which get or mutate your data.    
  # query {
  #   users() {
  #     name
  #     email
  #   }[]
  #   user(id: 1) {
  #     name
  #     email
  #   }
  # }
  # mutation {
  #   createUser(name: "Alice", email: "")"
  #   updateEmail(id: 1, email: "something@something.com")"
  #   deleteUser(id: 1)
  # }
  Apollo Server is a GraphQL server
    that works with any GraphQL schema.
  This has some advantages in overfetching, underfetching
    compared to restful API.

  - Query: Read
  - Mutation: Create, Update, Delete
